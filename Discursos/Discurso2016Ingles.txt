Today we commemorate the overwhelming victory of the Army of Gran Colombia in the Portete de
Tarqui, a date that was also consecrated as the day of the Ecuadorian Army, Civic Day and day
of the National Unity. To speak of Tarqui is to speak of Sucre and his military genius and greatness
human, in 1829 the great Marshal of Ayacucho tried a peaceful solution to avoid the
Battle against his former comrades in arms, the powerful Peruvian battalions
led by La Mar and Gamarra that had invaded the south of Gran Colombia, however
the clash was inevitable and the courage of Sucre and his squads under the command of officers like Flores,
O'Leary or Camacaro defeated an Army that doubled them in number.
Tarqui is one of the greatest lessons of the past and Sucre, the most loyal and most loved general
for Bolívar, he is a constant inspiration, the great Marshal always demanded the same before and
after the battle, because he maintained that victory does not give rights, which is known as
the Sucre Doctrine, he gave himself entirely to the liberating cause, just at the age of 15
he became part as Ensign of the Patriot Army, in 1813 he met Bolívar who influenced
decisively in their formation of him.
The remains of the Marshal by his express will rest in Quito, our Armies of
Land, Sea and Air are heirs to the virtues of the great Marshal.
Compatriots, soldiers of my country when we came to power in 2007 the situation of the
Armed Forces reflected the country's situation quite well, after giving us victory in
the Cenepa were practically abandoned by the civil power, in 2006 they barely reached
14% operational capacity, this was a true irresponsibility that we paid dearly
when we find ourselves defenseless in the face of the bombing by the Álvaro Uribe government on
March 2009, today the operational capacity in our Armies is one of the highest in the
history, in these years of government we have invested more than two billion dollars in
to repower our Armed Forces, almost 7 times more than what the Governments invested
between 2000 and 2006 that were 307 million dollars, which was not enough to replace the
few teams we had, although there is still a lot to do.
two
Today the Land Force has all its vehicles renewed, the Naval Force both
submarines absolutely repowered and converted into the most modern in the region
plus new coast guard boats, speedboats, drones. In 2007 the
The Air Force had practically ceased to exist but today it has a supersonic fleet, a fleet
subsonic of the most modern, new fleet of transport aircraft, unfortunately its
Dhruv helicopter fleet is paralyzed by 4 accidents, 2 of them due to mechanical failures,
In their malice even certain retired political officials went so far as to say that
Poor quality helicopters were deliberately bought, when these are selected,
tested and especially piloted by the same Air Force.
With recklessness it was even affirmed that there had been a surcharge in the purchase, when only the
insurance of the 4 injured by the revaluation of the devices in the world market already
exceeds the amount paid by the entire fleet, as you will see our intelligence is not respected and
even less the truth, the easiest thing to avoid so much infamy would be to do absolutely nothing,
but we will continue to do our duty.
We want to thank the outgoing command, Generals Luis Garzón, Carlos Obando, for their work.
Raúl Banderas and Rear Admiral Luis Santiago, the country thanks, recognizes their services,
our gratitude also to their families, we welcome and wish success in their
functions to the new military leadership: Vice Admiral Oswaldo Zambrano, head of the Command
set of the Armed Forces; Brigadier General Luis Castro Ayala, commander of the
Ground Force; Lieutenant General César Merizalde, Commander of the Air Force;
Vice Admiral Ángel Sarzosa Commander of the Naval Force; all of them excellent officers,
have the full support of the government of the citizen's revolution and its commander in
boss, the President of the Republic.
Like Sucre in Tarqui: "There is no battle more painful than the one faced by friends",
But as he also said: “There are battles that are not sought, they are presented and it is worth
give them ”. We have always been in favor of the stability of the controls and indeed in our
government and after probably decades at last the commands lasted the maximum
established in the law, but let us understand that we live a rule of law, a democracy
vibrant where it is not possible to accept that the uniformed men make public expressions of
legal - administrative aspects and without the authorization of the legitimate civil authority, I heard
a few days ago some of the officers said that they acted according to their convictions,
We are in a free country, we all have the right to have our convictions, but those
convictions are subordinate to the law and in the case of the Armed Forces to the
indispensable hierarchy and subordination to the civil power.
Today it is argued that it was the president who allegedly broke the law in the so-called
ISSFA case, that is not true but even if it were in a rule of law, it is not the high
commanded the referee of the decisions of civil society worse than his commander-in-chief, the
Article 159 of the Constitution of the Republic establishes that the Armed Forces are
obedient and not deliberative, that is not a dead letter, it is a vital part of a democracy, a
command has a moral and professional obligation to ensure the welfare of its soldiers, but
This cannot be confused with becoming union leaders of active soldiers and
passive, this is extremely dangerous because unlike other leaders they would have the
force of arms.
There is a profound misconception, listen to me dear cadets, midshipman,
soldiers; there is a profound misconception incompatible with the Constitution, the State
3
of law and above all with the society of justice and equity that we all long for,
I was listening the other day to a high officer in passive service, very respectful by the way, not
spoiled like these gentlemen we have just seen, I heard him argue that the ISSFA
is an integral part of the Armed Forces, the ISSFA is not part of the Armed Forces, whose
mission, structure and competence are clearly determined in articles 158 to 162 of
the Constitution of the Republic, the ISSFA is part of the country's social security system as
It is clearly established in article 370 of the Constitution that I allow myself to read, article 370:
"The Ecuadorian Institute of Social Security, an autonomous entity regulated by law, will be
responsible for the provision of the contingencies of the compulsory universal social insurance to their
affiliates. The National Police and the Armed Forces may have a special regime of
social security in accordance with the law, their social security entities will be part of the
comprehensive public health network and the social security system ”.
Thanks to the latest constitutional amendments, the paragraph was added to this article, I quote: “The
The State guarantees the payment of retirement pensions for members of the Armed Forces and
the National Police ”. Due to this serious, very serious conceptual confusion, according to the law of
creation of ISSFA, prior to the Constitution, its director must be an officer on active duty
with the rank of general or admiral, that is, soldiers of the country, if there was only one admiral or
general in the Republic, in case of war we could not use it in defense because it would be
in charge of administering the ISSFA, these are all clear deviations from the mission of our
Armed Forces, but this also shows lags of the old country that happily has
absent from this meeting their representatives this morning, this shows lags in the
old country, that of the society of tight groups and not of the common good, actually what
is absent in these visions is the construction of a true labor system and
social security as ordered by the Constitution in its article 370 and to which we all have
law regardless of whether it is public or private, civil or uniformed, but
considering, therefore, the special regime, the different specificities in this case of the
profession of soldier, for example military life is very hard and contemplates exhausting
days without being able to consider overtime, that is why the LOSEP, the Organic Law of Service
Public, in its article 115, correctly established compensations, for overtime that is
They pay upon promotion.
In the case of retirements, as this senior retired official also said to whom I listened in
a television program, given the pyramidal structure of the Armed Forces, the military
have to withdraw forcibly and prematurely so that in all parts of the world they receive
retirement pensions before civil society, to each specificity a fair compensation,
but everything that is not specific to military life must be analogous to the rest of the system,
Otherwise, it would be breaking with basic principles of social equity.
Unfortunately this is precisely what has happened, while in the civil sector the
Retirement is based on the average salary of the last 5 years, in the military sector it is in
based on the last salary received, with which a general who retires the day after
Promoted earns a general pension for life; while the civil sector
Pensions are adjusted according to inflation, in the military sector they increase with the
salary of the assets and as these salaries in a fair way and made by our
government have risen considerably, no one here is arguing about the decent salaries of
our Armed Forces, and despite the pressure of the usual opponents I never
I will regret paying decent salaries to the public servants of the country, and how these
Salaries in a fair way have risen considerably, pensions have also
raised, in this case not so fair, in fact by not paying taxes and having less
discounts with assets in a probably unique situation in the world, an officer in
4
Passive service receives greater net income than an asset and we are talking in addition to the
highest military salaries in the region.
While in the civil sector, even if the contributor has had a multimillionaire salary, for being
a solidarity system there is a maximum ceiling for pensions, in the military and police sectors
These pensions have no limits, this has produced that the maximum pension in the sector
military is 2.4 times higher than the maximum in the civil sector and has even caused that within
of the same military pensions there is a difference of 6.5 times between the highest and lowest
pension, the terrible differences in pensions within the military sector itself and between the
military and civilian are absolutely unjustifiable and clear sources of inequity, there should be the
same maximum pension for the whole society and in turn this maximum pension should be a
reasonable multiple of the minimum pension in that company to avoid cruel differences by
at least in the last stage of life.
Although this is far from being called social equity, it has been very difficult to correct it due to
misunderstood autonomy of ISSFA and ISSPOL, despite the fact that the Constitution again
clearly states that they are part of the country's health and social security system, similar
Situations occur with unemployment, understood in the military sector as compensation for
end of career, in the civil sector when a person leaves the public service receives a
compensation of five basic salaries for each year worked, even in the case of the president of the
Republic or the simplest secretary, but in the military sector the one who earns the most has the most
unemployment without having any relationship with what was contributed to the lake of the years since it is not
individual accounts but a pay-as-you-go fund, being an absolutely regressive system
because the one who earns the most is subsidized more, not the one who earns the least, the one who earns the most, in the sector
civil a person retires with a maximum of $ 53,100 after 40 years of service of
work, in the military sector an officer with this time of service retires with more than 200 thousand
dollars, the soldier and the State contribute to the unemployment, but if the soldier retires before
the five years can not even withdraw their contributions from him, if he retires before the age of 20 he can
withdraw your contributions from him but not those of the State which remain in the ISSFA and are used for finances
the highest unemployment rates.
All of this increases inequality, this has to change and, as in the civil sector,
Severance payments must be the same for troops and officers, depending exclusively on the years
worked and not based on salary, so I insist even at the time of retirement
achieve a little more equity.
Today I was ashamed to learn that the ranch of our soldiers is three dollars per
day, I do not understand how these inconsistencies have been able to pass the highest salaries of the
region but barely three dollars for the ranch, the absurdities that our government still commits
for which I apologize especially to our troops, of course we must correct
urgently this problem, but we must also talk about other problems, those
exorbitant severance pay subsidized by the State, where an Army general receives, as
one who has just retired more than $ 200,000 upon retirement, or from retirement pensions
of about $ 5,000 that some of the mourners who were marching for
here, also subsidized by the State, I assure you that by distributing those
resources could also eat better our soldiers.
It is understood that in active service there are salary differences based on
responsibilities and hierarchies, but it is not justified that in passive service they remain so
great and serious differences, as well as the unjustified differences are not understood
between civil and uniformed sector.
5
In addition, since we talk about ranch, it is also necessary to commit to never again
tolerate the insulting practices of different food for troops and officers, different dishes,
different parties, different clubs, some with all the luxuries, the others just a shed,
We are all the same, we all eat the same, we all have the right to live the same.
An extreme case of discrimination, but representative, occurred in the National Police, had
two police high schools in Quito, one to the north, an upper-middle-class neighborhood for the children of
officers and another to the south, a poor neighborhood for the children of the troops, that is, discrimination from
childhood, this never again soldiers of my country, never again dear compatriots, we will be
much more radical to achieve equity, I will issue the corresponding decrees and reforms
legal so that these discriminatory practices are absolutely prohibited, part
Fundamental of this radical equity is, in addition to the free military schools, the
absolute meritocracy, today the exams are taken separately for young people who want to
enter the officer or troop school respectively, those were not my orders has to
There will be only one exam and as long as there is space the best qualified applicants will decide which
school to enter, meritocracy and gratuity companions, source of equity.
Finally, another senior officer in passive duty, this time in not very good shape.
respectfully stated that Ecuador is the only country in the region where the military contributes to
social security, this is precisely the result of pretending that the ISSFA has autonomy
financial, a much simpler and more transparent system would be for the soldier to receive a
net salary and that all alleged personal and employer contributions were paid by
the only employer, the State, paid directly to the ISSFA, only with this adjustment
accounting, the non-contribution claimed by the aforementioned official would be achieved.
The problem is not the ISSFA, the Constitution allows it, the problem is pretending that it is
financially autonomous or wealth-creating, when 100% of your resources came and
they come directly or indirectly from the state.
Dear compatriots, the reason for being of public authority is the common good, I am the
President of the Republic, that is to say, public affairs, what belongs to everyone; we have to go from
the fragmented society that we receive the society of equity where we all have
equal rights, as always they will try to confuse cause with effect, the one that causes
problems is not the one that originates them according to these people, to these sources, the problem is
who evidences them, as the great Simón Bolívar said: “They will not dominate us by force
but because of ignorance ”and as Alberto Cortez, my favorite singer-songwriter says:“ In a world of
the blind, the one who opens their eyes is suspected ”, we men of good have the certainty that the
history will know how to put things in their place.
As I receive the offenses according to the quality of the offender, for example the departure of officers in
passive service, representatives of the old country, are undeserved decorations
my chest today.
Eloy Alfaro was called a tyrant, dictator, and despot for taking away idle assets from the church,
for giving us freedom, justice, dignity; Today even this field is called Eloy Alfaro, the most
great Ecuadorian of all time, we still have a democracy too
immature where an administrative problem between two public institutions aims to
destabilize the country, in the conflict over land in Los Samanes the first question that
we should ask all Ecuadorians is why the ISSFA had land
originally intended for national defense?
6
This has to end, in these years of government, dear compatriots I have been lucky
to meet many soldiers of honor who have given me real life lessons,
will always be present in my soul with deep affection and admiration, my former head of security
Colonel John Merino of the Air Infantry, who in August 2009 left the Assembly
President re-elected to take office again, when there was an epidemic of the
called swine flu and did not notify us that he had symptoms several days ago, after that
Assembly, leaving me in the National Assembly, he went directly to the emergency room and never again
he left, lost his life, a true hero of the country.
How to forget one of the many hostesses I have had, extraordinary officers and dear ones
friends, I will not say his name from him I would not forgive myself, but for those weird mean things that
exist in the Forces sometimes, for having been aide-de-camp to the president as a punishment
sent back to the Amazon, despite the fact that the position no longer corresponded to their rank of
colonel and additionally his wife had just given birth, when I learned of the injustice I told him
Colonel I am going to order that they return him to Quito and he was almost insubordinate, he asked me emphatically
"Please, President, do not do it, I will do my duty so I know that it is an injustice" and
he completed his year in the Amazon and then asked for retirement.
How to forget that dear friend, extraordinary father, husband, example of simplicity, the pilot
President Héctor Caicedo, who lost his life in February 2013 in the Dhruv accident
presidential.
How not to admire, thank my presidential protection team, dear friends, witnesses
privileged of my deep and numerous abysses and my few golden peaks, but
also witnesses of that inexhaustible work, day by day with infinite love for the country for the sake of
all, for a fairer, more equitable, more dignified, more sovereign society; these dear
friends who on September 30, 2010 were willing to lose their lives to defend their
commander-in-chief, they are all examples of life really.
But I have also met those who are hard to believe were soldiers, supposed heroes
claiming perks in the streets, blocking roads, etc., occupying squares,
contradicting the very definition of heroes that is the one who fulfills beyond his duty without
expect reward, I have also met traitors to the homeland who on the first of March
2008 served foreign governments and not their own, passive duty officers who
they think that the country begins and ends in the Armed Forces and that abusively
intend in the war of life to build the safest trenches exclusively for
them without thinking of others, officers in passive service who invoke their love for the institution
while they try to exploit it for the lowest politicking.
It is normal dear soldiers, this is the case in any human group, the important thing is the vision
that predominates as an institution and here with all the appreciation, affection, gratitude that I have for him
General Garzón, I have to tell you that I do not share your vision of him, that usual speech, the
institution as an end in itself and calling itself the "backbone of the country", I
It seems tremendously exclusive, so the Police are not part of that backbone?
Are we professionals not part of that spinal column? Our mothers who
raised with so much love and many of you are here for the sacrifice of a mother who
unveiled day after day to give us education, food is not part of that column
vertebral? We are all the backbone of the country, we are all important to him
new Ecuador, we are all fundamental pillars, our Armed Forces, our Police
National, professionals, students, artisans, farmers, housewives;
7
precisely that is what is in dispute, those two visions, claiming a more
important than another, or that the country begins and ends in an institution no matter how important
be it, or know that we are all workers, that we are all workers to build the homeland
new, the dignified homeland, the homeland of each and everyone.
We must look for Armed Forces that are means not ends, that fulfill their duty of
defend the homeland but without believing themselves more important than others, an Armed Forces without
the great inequalities that exist within it and with soldiers who expect neither more nor less
benefits than other citizens, many times I have heard of the military family,
what a beautiful term, how good; But dear soldiers never stop thinking about the
families of the rest, we all have rights, we all build the homeland day by day, the soldier
with her heroism from him but also the informal merchant with her daily sweat from him, the single mothers
with his infinite love for his children, the workers with their callused hands, the peasants with their
plow and hoe, the example of the true soldier is the one described by Bolívar in the
Caracas Assembly on January 2, 1814: “A happy soldier does not acquire any right
to command his homeland from him, he is not the arbiter of the laws or the government, he is the defender of his
freedom, his glories must be confused with those of the republic, and his ambition for him must remain
satisfied by making the happiness of her country ”.
To the new command, good luck and all the support of the comrade president and you
soldiers of the homeland gratitude, recognition and commitment to work together for the
new homeland, the homeland of all and of all.
Until victory always compatriots!
